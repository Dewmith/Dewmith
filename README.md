👋 Hey there, I’m Dewmith

🎓 Data Science Engineer (Master’s in Data Engineering – EPF Montpellier, France)

💻 I love working with data and networks, finding creative ways to make life easier, sometimes a bit more fun, for people.

I enjoy turning messy data into something useful and building random projects that make everyday life geekier or simpler (usually when am bored).

🚀 Always curious, always tinkering, always building something awesome.

Let's connect and create something fun!
